# TODO:

    1): Make a instruction set

        Requirements:

            1): All instructions need to be 1 byte

            2): Must be simple/human readable


    2): Make a Interpreter for the instruction set

        Requirements:

            1): No garbage collection built into the interpeter

            2): Must be able to extent interpreter

            3): Must allow for C like control of memory

            4): Must be fast
